# 🚀 Session Start - Environment & Version Checks

## IMPORTANT: Run These Checks at the START of Every New Session

**Order of operations:**

1. **Detect Environment** (Local vs Codespaces - for correct URLs)
2. **Check Template Version** (run script silently)
3. **Read Project Status** (if exists)
4. **Greet User** (include update notification if available)

---

## 1️⃣ Detect Environment (Run Silently)

**Run this once at session start to determine correct testing URLs:**

```bash
if [ -n "$CODESPACES" ]; then echo "CODESPACES: $CODESPACE_NAME"; else echo "LOCAL"; fi
```

**Results:**

| Result | Environment | Local Test URL |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `CODESPACES: xxx-yyy` | GitHub Codespaces | `https://{CODESPACE_NAME}-8080.app.github.dev` |
| `LOCAL` | Local machine | `http://localhost:8080` |

**Production URL is always:** `https://<repo-name>.vibe.992872368362.cloud.bayer.com`

---

## 2️⃣ Check for Platform Updates (Run Silently)

**Run the check script:**

```bash
./scripts/check-updates.sh
```

**Interpret the output:**

| Output | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `UP_TO_DATE` | No updates available | Don't mention updates |
| `UPDATE_AVAILABLE\|old\|new` | Update available | Offer update in greeting |
| `CHECK_FAILED` | Couldn't check (network, etc.) | Don't mention updates, continue normally |

**Store the result** - you'll use it in the greeting.

---

## 3️⃣ Read Project Status

**Check if this is a returning user:**

```bash
cat docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md 2>/dev/null
```

- If status shows work done → This is a returning user
- If status is fresh/empty → This is a new user

---

## 4️⃣ Greet User

**After completing the silent checks above, greet the user appropriately.**

### For Returning Users (PROJECT_STATUS.md shows work done)

```
👋 Welcome back!

Last time we [summary from Latest Session in PROJECT_STATUS.md].
Your project: [Project Idea from status]

Ready to continue? Or would you like to work on something different?
```

Then if updates are available (`UPDATE_AVAILABLE`), add:
```
📦 By the way, a platform update is available (v{old} → v{new}). Want me to update now? (Your code won't be affected)
```

### For New Users (PROJECT_STATUS.md empty or doesn't exist)

**Use the welcome message from `02-welcome-modes.md`** - it has the full 3-question onboarding flow.

If updates are available, mention it briefly after the welcome:
```
📦 Quick note: A platform update is available. I can apply it anytime - just ask!
```

---

**IMPORTANT:** The detailed welcome flow, beginner/developer modes, and communication styles are defined in `02-welcome-modes.md`. This file handles the technical checks that happen BEFORE the greeting.

---

## 5️⃣ If User Says "Yes" to Update

**Simply run the apply script:**

```bash
./scripts/apply-updates.sh
```

**The script will:**
1. Fetch the manifest from the template repo
2. Download all files listed in `auto_update` section
3. Update the version tracker
4. Output what was updated

**Watch for the output:**
- `UPDATE_COMPLETE|<version>` → Success!
- `UPDATE_FAILED|<reason>` → Something went wrong

### After Update - Tell User

```
✅ Updated to version [version from script output]!

[List files that were updated from script output]

Your code (frontend/*, backend/*, database/init/*) was NOT touched.

Ready to continue?
```

---

## 6️⃣ If User Says "No" or "Later"

```
No problem! You can update anytime by asking me to "update platform files".

Now, what would you like to work on?
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Codespaces

1. **GitHub CLI**: The scripts use `gh api` (pre-authenticated in Codespaces)
2. **Git Operations**: User may need to commit after updates
3. **No Sudo**: Don't use sudo commands
4. **Working Directory**: Always run scripts from repo root

## 📋 Quick Reference: What Gets Updated

| Category | Files | When Updated |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Platform files** | deploy.yml, Dockerfile templates, AI rules | When user approves |

## 🛠️ Manual Update Commands

If user asks to update manually or the scripts don't work:

```bash
# Check for updates
./scripts/check-updates.sh

# Apply updates
./scripts/apply-updates.sh
```

Or user can say: **"Update platform files"** or **"Check for updates"**
